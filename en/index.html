                    <p class="alzheimer__headline--info">The causes of Alzheimer’s disease are still unidentified. Prevention is barely possible, as Alzheimer’s disease could only be confirmed through an autopsy in the past. Some reports say Alzheimer’s disease begins 20 years before symptoms appear. It is too late to stop when you start to see the symptoms. In particular, about 20% of Asians have ApoE4 genes, which are vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. The success rate of new drug development converges to 0%. Only four drugs were approved until 2003, all of which work to alleviate symptoms without fundamentally treating the disease. Since 2003, there has been no new drug approved. So, it is more hopeless. </p>

He has reviewed 121 agents, as of February 27, 2020, currently being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in 131 clinical trials. What is the basis for this?</p>

                    <p class="conversion__content--before-detail"><strong class="conversion__now">Past</strong>Professor Cummings's optimism is not an illogical delusion. Research on Alzheimer's disease has undergone a significant transformation in recent years to the extent that the paradigm has shifted. The medical community's perspectives on Alzheimer's disease are changing. Until recently, the major hypothesis for Alzheimer’s disease was that the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques causes Alzheimer’s disease, as observed in an autopsy of the patient who died of Alzheimer’s disease. There has been an argument that the beta-amyloid may be a consequence, not a cause of the disease. This is because removing beta-amyloid plaques did not improve the symptoms. </p>

Various studies suggest that Alzheimer’s disease may be caused by beta-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, oxidation, vasculature, and immunity. New parameters (biomarkers) specific for Alzheimer’s disease are being developed, accelerating clinical trials, and the development process. Also, treatments for other diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure are sometimes effective in treating Alzheimer’s disease; hopes are growing for new drug development. </p>

Many drugs targeting beta-amyloid received attention as global pharmaceutical companies have been developing but recently they have not been successful. Clinical trials of ponezumab of Pfizer in 2013, solanezumab of Eli Lilly in 2016, and crenezumab of Roche in 2019 have failed.

In other words, drugs are being developed to work in a complex manner through various mechanisms of action.

                            GV1001 of GemVax & KAEL is a drug derived from telomerase. The telomerase is an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres. 
                            When it was discovered in 1987, it resonated not only in academia but also in the medical community. This is due to the properties of telomeres.

                            The three scientists who have discovered a relationship between telomerase and telomeres received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009. Norwegian scientists originally developed GV1001, and it is known to have anti-cancer immune effects, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-aging effects. Currently, it is being developed by a Korean company, GemVax & KAEL. Phase II clinical trial of GV1001 for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease conducted in Korea has been completed, and GemVax is preparing for phase III clinical trial.
